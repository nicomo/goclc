# goclc package

goclc is a CLI front for the [oclcapis](https://github.com/nicomo/oclcapis) package, which itself uses _some_ of the _free, public_ Web Services available from OCLC.

OCLC offers many web services not implemented here, some only accessible to member libraries. The web services are documented at <https://platform.worldcat.org/api-explorer/apis>
